        Another publishing industry practice that has been highly criticized is
        "bundling", or shrink-wrapping supplemental items into a
        textbook.[citation needed] Supplemental items range from CD-ROMs and
        workbooks to online passcodes and bonus material. Students often cannot
        buy these things separately, and often the one-time-use supplements
        destroy the resale value of the textbook.[15] According to the Student
        PIRGs, the typical bundled textbook is 10%-50% more[clarification
        needed] than an unbundled textbook, and 65% of professors said they
        “rarely” or “never” use the bundled items in their courses.[12] A 2005
        Government Accountability Office (GAO) Report in the United States found
        that the production of these supplemental items was the primary cause of
        rapidly increasing prices: While publishers, retailers, and wholesalers
        all play a role in textbook pricing, the primary factor contributing to
        increases in the price of textbooks has been the increased investment
        publishers have made in new products to enhance instruction and
        learning...While wholesalers, retailers, and others do not question the
        quality of these materials, they have expressed concern that the
        publishers’ practice of packaging supplements with a textbook to sell as
        one unit limits the opportunity students have to purchase less expensive
        used books....If publishers continue to increase these investments,
        particularly in technology, the cost to produce a textbook is likely to
        continue to increase in the future.[16] Bundling has also been used to
        segment the used book market. Each combination of a textbook and
        supplemental items receives a separate ISBN. A single textbook could
        therefore have dozens of ISBNs that denote different combinations of
        supplements packaged with that particular book. When a bookstore
        attempts to track down used copies of textbooks, they will search for
        the ISBN the course instructor orders, which will locate only a subset
        of the copies of the textbook. Legislation at state and federal levels
        seeks to limit the practice of bundling, by requiring publishers to
        offer all components separately.[17] Publishers have testified in favor
        of bills including this provision,[18] but only in the case that the
        provision exempts the loosely defined category of "integrated
        textbooks." The Federal bill[19] only exempts 3rd party materials in
        integrated textbooks, however publisher lobbyists have attempted to
        create a loophole through this definition in state bills. Given that the
        problem of high textbook prices is linked to the "broken" economics of
        the market, requiring publishers to disclose textbook prices to faculty
        is a solution pursued by a number of legislatures.[22] By inserting
        price into sales interactions, this regulation will supposedly make the
        economic forces operate more normally. No data suggests that this is in
        fact true. However, The Student PIRGs have found that publishers
        actively withhold pricing information from faculty, making it difficult
        to obtain. Their most recent study found that 77% of faculty say
        publisher sales representatives do not volunteer prices, and only 40%
        got an answer when they directly asked. Furthermore, the study found
        that 23% of faculty rated publisher websites as “informative and easy to
        use” and less than half said they typically listed the price.[23] The US
        Congress passed a law in the 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act that
        would require price disclosure.[17][24][25] Legislation requiring price
        disclosure has passed in Connecticut,[26] Washington,[27][28]
        Minnesota,[29] Oregon,[27] Arizona,[30] Oklahoma,[31] and Colorado.[21]
        Publishers are currently supporting price disclosure mandates, though
        they insist that the "suggested retail price"[32] should be disclosed,
        rather than the actual price the publisher would get for the book. As
        for buyback on a specific campus, faculty decisions largely determine
        how much a student receives. If a professor chooses to use the same book
        the following semester, even if it is a custom text, designed
        specifically for an individual instructor, bookstores often buy the book
        back. The GAO report found that, generally, if a book is in good
        condition and will be used on the campus again the next term, bookstores
        will pay students 50 percent of the original price paid. If the
        bookstore has not received a faculty order for the book at the end of
        the term and the edition is still current, they may offer students the
        wholesale price of the book, which could range from 5 to 35 percent of
        the new retail price, according to the GAO report.[16]
