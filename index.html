        The history of textbooks dates back to ancient civilizations. For
        example, Ancient Greeks wrote educational texts. The modern textbook has
        its roots in the mass production made possible by the printing press.
        Johannes Gutenberg himself may have printed editions of Ars Minor, a
        schoolbook on Latin grammar by Aelius Donatus. Early textbooks were used
        by tutors and teachers (e.g. alphabet books), as well as by individuals
        who taught themselves. The Greek philosopher Socrates lamented the loss
        of knowledge because the media of transmission were changing. Before the
        invention of the Greek alphabet 2,500 years ago, knowledge and stories
        were recited aloud, much like Homer's epic poems. The new technology of
        writing meant stories no longer needed to be memorized, a development
        Socrates feared would weaken the Greeks' mental capacities for
        memorizing and retelling. (Ironically, we know about Socrates' concerns
        only because they were written down by his student Plato in his famous
        Dialogues.) [4] The next revolution in the field of books came with the
        15th-century invention of printing with changeable type. The invention
        is attributed to German metalsmith Johannes Gutenberg, who cast type in
        molds using a melted metal alloy and constructed a wooden-screw printing
        press to transfer the image onto paper. Gutenberg's first and only
        large-scale printing effort was the now iconic Gutenberg Bible in the
        1450s — a Latin translation from the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek
        New Testament. Gutenberg's invention made mass production of texts
        possible for the first time. Although the Gutenberg Bible itself was
        expensive, printed books began to spread widely over European trade
        routes during the next 50 years, and by the 16th century, printed books
        had become more widely accessible and less costly.[5] While many
        textbooks were already in use, compulsory education and the resulting
        growth of schooling in Europe led to the printing of many more textbooks
        for children. Textbooks have been the primary teaching instrument for
        most children since the 19th century. Two textbooks of historical
        significance in United States schooling were the 18th century New
        England Primer and the 19th century McGuffey Readers. Recent
        technological advances have changed the way people interact with
        textbooks. Online and digital materials are making it increasingly easy
        for students to access materials other than the traditional print
        textbook. Students now have access to electronic books ("e-books"),
        online tutoring systems and video lectures. An example of an e-book is
        Principles of Biology from Nature Publishing. Most notably, an
        increasing number of authors are avoiding commercial publishers and
        instead offering their textbooks under a creative commons or other open
        license.

        Some students save money by buying used copies of textbooks, which tend
        to be less expensive, and are available from many college bookstores in
        the US, who buy them back from students at the end of a term. Books that
        are not being re-used at the school are often purchased by an off-campus
        wholesaler for 0-30% of the new cost, for distribution to other
        bookstores. Some textbook companies have countered this by encouraging
        teachers to assign homework that must be done on the publisher's
        website. Students with a new textbook can use the pass code in the book
        to register on the site; otherwise they must pay the publisher to access
        the website and complete assigned homework. Students who look beyond the
        campus bookstore can typically find lower prices. With the ISBN or
        title, author and edition, most textbooks can be located through online
        used book sellers or retailers. Most leading textbook companies publish
        a new edition every 3 or 4 years, more frequently in math and science.
        Harvard economics chair James K. Stock has stated that new editions are
        often not about significant improvements to the content. "New editions
        are to a considerable extent simply another tool used by publishers and
        textbook authors to maintain their revenue stream, that is, to keep up
        prices."[11] A study conducted by The Student PIRGs found that a new
        edition costs 12% more than a new copy of the previous edition (not
        surprising if the old version is obsolete), and 58% more than a used
        copy of the previous edition. Textbook publishers maintain these new
        editions are driven by demand from teachers. That study found that 76%
        of teachers said new editions were justified “half of the time or less”
        and 40% said they were justified “rarely” or “never”.[12] The PIRG study
        has been criticized by publishers, who argue that the report contains
        factual inaccuracies regarding the annual average cost of textbooks per
        student.[13] The Student PIRGs also point out that recent emphasis on
        e-textbooks does not always save students money. Even though the book
        costs less up-front, the student will not recover any of the cost
        through resale.[14]
